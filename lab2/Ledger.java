     * A naive check would just check whether each entry of a outputlist of a Transaction 
     *   can be deducted
     *
     * But there could be an output for the same user Alice of say 10 units twice
     *   where there are not enough funds to deduct it twice but enough
     *   funds to deduct it once
     * The naive check would succeed, but after converting the ouput list of a Transaction
     *  to UserAmount we obtain that for Alice 20 units have to be deducted
     *  so the deduction of the UserAmount created fails.
     *
     * One could try for checking that one should actually deduct each entry in squence
     *   but then one has to backtrack again.
     * Converting the TransactionOutputList into a UserAmount
     *   is a better approach since the outputlist of a Transaction
     *   is usually much smaller than the main Ledger.
